Iris Dataset Analysis with Machine Learning Algorithms

This repository contains code for analyzing the famous Iris dataset using various machine learning algorithms.
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for educational purposes and benchmarking algorithms.

## Algorithms Implemented

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**:
   - The KNN algorithm is a simple and effective classification algorithm that classifies each sample based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

2. **Neural Network (NN)**:
   - The neural network algorithm is a powerful machine learning algorithm that learns complex patterns in the data through a network of interconnected neurons.

## Preprocessing Techniques

1. **Scaling Data**:
   - Scaling the data ensures that each feature contributes equally to the distance-based algorithms like KNN. It helps in improving the performance and convergence of the algorithms.

2. **Shuffling Data**:
   - Shuffling the data is essential to remove any inherent bias or patterns in the dataset order. It helps in preventing the algorithms from learning the order of the samples and improves generalization.
